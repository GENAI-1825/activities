# PY-CL-NLTK

You should have nltk installed and have popular packages from nltk downloaded.
If not, run the following commands:

From terminal:
```bash
$ pip install nltk
$ python
$ import nltk
$ nltk.download('popular')
$ exit()
```

This will install nltk library and download nltk's 'popular' packages.
